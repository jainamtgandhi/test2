# Checkpoint 0805 - GTM Strategy & Sales Enablement Apps Fixed

## Date: August 5, 2024

## Summary
Fixed issues with GTM Strategy and Sales Enablement folder apps not opening/clickable. All apps are now properly registered and functional.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Missing App Registrations
**Problem**: Apps in GTM Strategy and Sales Enablement folders were not registered in the program registry, causing them to fail when clicked.

**Solution**: Added missing app registrations to `src/scripts/utils/programRegistry.js`:

#### GTM Strategy Apps Added:
- `launch-planning` - Launch Planning
- `campaign-execution` - Campaign Execution  
- `kpi-tracking` - KPI Tracking
- `cross-functional-alignment` - Cross-Functional Alignment

#### Sales Enablement Apps Added:
- `one-pagers-placeholder` - Sales Collateral
- `battlecards-placeholder` - Pitch Decks
- `email-templates-placeholder` - Sales Training
- `sales-decks-placeholder` - Customer Proof

### 2. Image Loading Issues
**Problem**: Some apps were trying to load placeholder text files instead of actual images.

**Solution**: Updated image paths in HTML files:

#### Fixed Files:
- `src/apps/kpi-tracking/kpi-tracking.html` - Updated to use `go-to-market-placeholder.webp`
- `src/apps/cross-functional-alignment/cross-functional-alignment.html` - Updated to use `go-to-market-placeholder.webp`

## Technical Details

### App Configuration
Each app is configured with:
- Dimensions: 258x725 pixels
- Minimum dimensions: 305x350 pixels
- Status bar text for zoom/pan functionality
- Menu bar with File and View options
- Correct app paths pointing to their HTML files
